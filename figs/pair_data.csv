These different historical experiences could lead to different levels of caution and wariness.

2. Cultural Norms: Cultural norms and values can also play a role. For example, many Pacific Islander cultures place a strong emphasis on community and collective responsibility, which might lead to a more cautious approach to protect the community as a whole.

3. Socioeconomic Factors: Socioeconomic factors can also influence caution. For instance, if a group is disproportionately affected by poverty, unemployment, or lack of access to quality education, they might be more cautious due to financial or safety concerns.

4. Geographical Factors: Geographical isolation can lead to unique cultural and societal structures. For instance, many Pacific Islands are remote and have small populations, which could contribute to a more insular, cautious society.

Pacific Islanders, particularly those from countries like Japan, Korea, China, and the Philippines, have a history of migration driven by economic opportunities.

Native Americans, on the other hand, have faced a long history of systematic oppression, including the forced removal from their lands, the displacement of their communities, and the destruction of their traditional ways of life.
